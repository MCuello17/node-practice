# Node Server (v1.3.0)
This is a node server example.

To run this code simply write the following in your terminal:

    npm start

Now head into http://localhost:3000 from a browser, this will show a website with an input for your name.

Once you type something and submit you will get redirected to the same URL and a `lead.txt` file will get created at the same path as app.js. That file will have the information you put on the input from the website.
